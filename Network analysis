TOOLS
Sensors
- in line, TAP (test access point), Man in the middle, placed between communicating devices to stop attacks, IPS or Firewall, impact latency
- out of band (passive), switched port analyzer, monitor network segments and detect attacks, not stop. Copies netework traffic, IDS, does not impact latency

TAP - placed between two network devices
no data loss, not scaleable, will need serveral installed to capture traffic for other network segments
MITM - attacker can use arp, sniff or manipulate traffic to flow through them, typically in the same network
SPAN - configured on network switch, best for packet collecion of traffic, scalable, high degree of packet loss, burdens the switch

FINGERPRINTING AND HOST IDENTIFICATION
variances in the RFC implementation for different OS's enables teh capabilites for fingerprinting
Tools used for finger and host id can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)
FINGERPRINTING
active os fingerprinting - easier, send packets to target and monitor responce, tools: nmap xprobe2 sinfp3
passive - more difficult, rely on sniffing packets, tools: p0f Ettercap PRADS

BASELINING
    Snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame
    No industry standard
    7 days to establish the initial snapshot
    Prerequisite Information
    Determines the current state of your network
    Ascertain the current utilization of network resources
    Identify normal vs peak network traffic time frames
    Verify port/protocol usage

        Known traffic "flows"
    Scope and Objectives:
        What traffic/protocols to capture?
        Which network segments?
        Which days?
        What times?

INDICATORS
    Indicator of Attack (IOA)
        Proactive
        A series of actions that are suspicious together
        Focus on Intent
        Looks for what must happen
            Code execution. persistence, lateral movement, etc.
    Indicator of Compromise (IOC)
        Reactive
        Forensic Evidence
        Provides Information that can change
            Malware, IP addresses, exploits, signatures
some indicators
    .exe/executable files
    NOP sled
    Repeated Letters
    Well Known Signatures
    Mismatched Protocols
    Unusual traffic
    Large amounts of traffic/ unusual times
signs of IOA

signs of IOC
    Unusual traffic outbound
    Anomalous user login or account use
    Size of responses for HTML
    High number of requests for the same files
    Using non-standard ports/ application-port mismatch
    Writing changes to the registry/system files
    Unexpected/unusual patching or tasks

TYPES OF MALWARE
ADWARE/SPYWARE

DETERMINE NETWORK ANOMALIES
ICMP tunneling
    ICMP PING uses Type 8 and Type 0
    Both should be:
        1 for 1
        Same size and payload
    Look out for:
        Request/Reply imbalances
        Abnormal/different payloads
DNS TUNNELING
    DNS uses Query/Response
        1 Query Typically gets 1 response
    Look out for:
        Query/Response imbalances
        Abnormal/different payloads
        Continuous Queries
HTTP(S) TUNNELING
    HTTP is "bursty" in nature
    Client issues request and the server responds
    Look out for:
        Steady connections
        HTTPs you will need to check session establishment for abnormalities
BEACONING
    Call back to the C&C server
    Gets/sends commands from/to C&C
    Look out for:
        Beacon Timing
            Commonly at regular intervals
        Beacon Size
            Check-Ins may not have any payloads
            Orders will have payloads
